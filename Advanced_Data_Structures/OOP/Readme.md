# 🛠️ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++

## 🎯 Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that views a problem in terms of the **objects** involved rather than the procedures to solve it. Consider a library management system. In procedural programming, you might focus on actions like issuing, returning, and adding books. However, in OOP, the focus shifts to the objects involved, such as the librarian, book, and member.

### Why Use Object-Oriented Programming?
In real life, we deal with objects such as people, cars, and accounts, each with attributes and behaviors. OOP allows software to mimic these real-world entities, making it less complex and more intuitive. Moreover, OOP facilitates **software reuse** by allowing you to create blueprints (classes) for objects and use them as needed.

## 📚 Classes and Objects
The concept of **classes** is fundamental to OOP. A class is a blueprint that defines the characteristics (data members) and behaviors (member functions) of objects. Classes tie together the data and functions, representing real-world entities.

### 🧱 Syntax for Defining a Class
```cpp
class ClassName {
    AccessModifier:
    DataMembers;
    MemberFunctions;
};
```

### Example: Defining a Simple Class
```cpp
class Student {
public:
    int rollno;
    char name[20];
};
```

### Declaring Objects of a Class
Objects of a class can be declared either **statically** or **dynamically**:

#### Static Declaration
```cpp
Student s1;  // Declares an object 's1' of type Student
Student s2;  // Declares another object 's2' of type Student
```

#### Dynamic Declaration
```cpp
Student *s1 = new Student;  // Dynamically declares an object of type Student
```

## 🔐 Access Modifiers
Access modifiers determine the accessibility of the class members. The main types are:

- **private:** Members are accessible only within the class.
- **public:** Members are accessible outside the class.

### Example: Using Access Modifiers
```cpp
class A {
private:
    int x, y;

public:
    int z;
    int twice() {
        return 2 * y;
    }
};
```

## 🔄 Getters and Setters
**Private members** are not accessible outside the class directly. To interact with these members, we use **getters** and **setters**.

- **Getter:** A method to access a data member without modifying it.
- **Setter:** A method to modify a data member.

### Example: Implementing Getters and Setters
```cpp
class Student {
private:
    int rollno;
    float marks;

public:
    int getRollno() {
        return rollno;
    }

    float getMarks() {
        return marks;
    }

    void setGrade() {
        if (marks > 90) grade = 'A';
        else if (marks > 80) grade = 'B';
        // Additional conditions...
    }
};
```

## 🔧 Constructors
A **constructor** is a special function used to initialize objects. It has the same name as the class and is automatically invoked when an object is created.

### Example: Default Constructor
```cpp
class Sum {
private:
    int a, b;

public:
    Sum() {  // Default constructor
        a = 10;
        b = 20;
    }

    int getSum() {
        return a + b;
    }
};
```

### Parameterized Constructor
Constructors can also take parameters to initialize objects with specific values.

```cpp
class Sum {
private:
    int a, b;

public:
    Sum(int num1, int num2) {  // Parameterized constructor
        a = num1;
        b = num2;
    }

    int getSum() {
        return a + b;
    }
};
```

## 🔄 Destructors
A **destructor** is a special function used to destroy objects and free up memory. It has the same name as the class, preceded by a tilde (`~`).

### Example: Destructor
```cpp
class Sum {
private:
    int a, b;

public:
    Sum(int num1, int num2) {
        cout << "Constructor at work" << endl;
        a = num1;
        b = num2;
    }

    ~Sum() {  // Destructor
        cout << "Destructor at work" << endl;
    }

    int getSum() {
        return a + b;
    }
};

int main() {
    Sum obj(4, 6);
}
```

## 🧠 The `this` Keyword
In C++, the `this` keyword is a pointer to the object that invokes a member function. It is used to differentiate between data members and parameters when they have the same name.

### Example: Using `this` Keyword
```cpp
class Sum {
private:
    int a, b;

public:
    Sum(int a, int b) {
        this->a = a;
        this->b = b;
    }

    int getSum() {
        return a + b;
    }
};
```

## 🚀 Summary
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ is a powerful paradigm that models real-world entities through classes and objects. With concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, OOP provides a flexible, reusable, and maintainable approach to software development.

Explore the following topics to deepen your understanding of OOP:

- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit.
- **Inheritance:** Mechanism to create new classes based on existing ones.
- **Polymorphism:** Ability to process objects differently based on their data type or class.
